          Surrounded by an eight acre eco-friendly garden, the property looks
          onto a jungle stream — a paradise for bird watchers and nature 
          lovers.
          Little dream is the perfect tranquil setting to relax and forget the 
          bustle of city life.
          Little dream is a wonderful place to stay at any
          time of the year. If the tourist trail is not for you you can spend 
          your days here, surrounded by lush green countryside watching the 
          clouds go by, or taking walks along the lake shore and exloring 
          the river and local countryside. Alternatively, were also 
          conveniently located close to Sigiria, Dambulla rock temple and many other 
          attractions and just 15 minutes from Dambulla. and of course 
          sampling our home cooked delicious Sri Lankan food.
