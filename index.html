          Tucked away close to lake Kandalama-wewa, 
          Little Dream guest house is a little gem. It has been a refuge for 
          tourists for over 20 years.

          Surrounded by an eight acre eco-friendly garden, the property looks
          onto a jungle stream â€” a paradise for bird watchers and nature 
          lovers.
          Little dream is the perfect tranquil setting to relax and forget the 
          bustle of city life.

          If the tourist trail is not for you you can spend 
          your days here, surrounded by lush green countryside watching the 
          clouds go by. You can take walks along the lake shore and exlore 
          the river and local countryside. Alternatively, 
          were conveniently close to Sigiria and many other 
          attractions. We're just 15 minutes from Dambulla.
