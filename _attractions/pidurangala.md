Pidurangala Raja Maha Viharaya is just a short distance from the Sigiriya 
Rock fortress. Although its origins date back to the same period this 
site does not share the renown as Sigiriya. Very few  percent of the visitors 
who flock to Sigiriya, spare a glance at this ancient shrine. Located down a 
dusty gravel track off the road leading to Sigiriya, the Pidurangala 
monastery was built by King Kashyapa in the 5th Century A.D. Inside the small,
dark cave are five Buddha statues.
