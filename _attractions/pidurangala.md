Pidurangala Raja Maha Viharaya is just a short distance from the Sigiriya Rock fortress. Although its origins date back to the same period this 
site does not share the same glamour and renown of Sigiiya. Not even 10 percent of the visitors who flock to Sigiriya, spare a glance at this ancient shrine.Located down a dusty gravel track off the road leading to Sigiriya, the Pidurangala monastery was built by King Kashyapa in the 5th 
Century A.D.Inside the small, dark cave are five Buddha statues. Two standing images of the Buddha are old, having been found in the cave when it 
was excavated, Nilantha said.The other three statues had been constructed later. All the statues and the wall of the rock have been painted at 
some time, making it difficult to distinguish the old from the new. The paint on the old statues however, is peeling off revealing the stone 
beneath.
