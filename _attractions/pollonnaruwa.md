Polonnaruwa is undoubtedly one of the major tourist attractions of the Sri Lankan cultural triangle. This marvelous ruin is now covered by the jungle and is beautifully located, along side the huge man made tank named Parakrama Samudra. The tank was named after the king who commissioned it and developed Polonnaruwa as the medieval capital of the Island in the 12th century. It is also one of the renowned archeological sites funded by UNESCO. Today you can visit the well preserved Hindu and Buddhist monuments that belongs to the same era, giving evidence of the proud local history. Do not forget to spend a few moments at the Gal Vihara temple, where you can see the marvelous Buddha statues carved in a single rock.
