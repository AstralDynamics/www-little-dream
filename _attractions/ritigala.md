A famous archeological site known as a ‘forest hermitage complex’ was a monastery for Buddhist monks. The area is a well protected nature reserve where wild life is plenty. It is abundant in wild elephants, leopards, bears and a large number of birds. When visiting you will discover the ruined lodgings of monks, ancient Ayurveda centers, water tanks and natural caves with Brahmin inscriptions from the 2nd and 3rd century BC.
