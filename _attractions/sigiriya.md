Built in the 5th century AD, this magnificent complex of geometrically laid
gardens, pools, and fountains, still working today. It was the  palace of the
King Kasyapa. Built on top of a 200m high rock, the entrance to the climb was 
once through a huge stone lions head, though only the huge paws remain today.
Half way up the rock is beautifully painted with images of bare-breasted
Maidens whose identity is still a mystery. The occupation of the
gigantic fortress ended when Kasyapa killed himself in a battle with his
brother.
