Polonnaruwa is one of the major visited attractions of the Sri Lankan cultural 
triangle. This marvelous ruined city is now covered by jungle, it is located,
along side the huge man made tank named Parakrama Samudra. The tank was named 
after the king who commissioned it and developed Polonnaruwa as the 
medieval capitals of the Island in the 12th century. It is
World Herritage archeological site funded by UNESCO. Today you can visit the 
well preserved Hindu and Buddhist monuments that belongs to the same era,
giving evidence of the proud local history. Do not forget to spend a few
moments at the Gal Vihara temple, where you can see marvelous Buddha
statues carved in a single rock.
