Dating back to the 1st century BC, this is the most impressive cave temple in
Asia. It has five caves under a vast overhanging rock, carved with a drip line
to keep the interiors dry. In 1938 the architecture was embellished with arched
colonnades and gabled entrances. Inside the caves, the ceilings are painted
with intricate patterns of religious images following the contours of the rock.
There are images of the Lord Buddha and bodhisattvas, as well as various gods
and goddesses.
